OCT 31 --  Time Graph file,   neurons vs time  (made in excel already but probably should stay consistent and use matplotlib

NOV 1 Master -- 3D Dropout/Weight/Accuracy

NOV 9 Compiled --  2D Accuracy vs Training Ratio (multi line for different models)
		-- 2D F1 Score vs Training Ratio (multi line for different models)
		-- 2D Time vs Training Ratio (multi line for different models)

F1 = 2 ·((precision · recall) / (precision + recall))     Best value is at 1   worst value is at 0

precision = true positives / (false positives + true positives)

recall = true positives / (false negatives + true positives)
